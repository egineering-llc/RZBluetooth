/**
 * RZBEnableMock swizzles [CBCentralManager alloc] and [CBPeripheralManager alloc] 
 * so consumers of Core Bluetooth can use the mocked objects without injecting them
 * in the consumer side. Once RZBEnableMock(YES) is called, the object returned by
 * [CBCentralManager alloc] will actually be an RZBMockCentralManager, and the object
 * returned by [CBPeripheralManager alloc] will conform to RZBMockPeripheralManager.
 *
 * I know this sounds terrifying but it works great in objective-c. HOWEVER, in Swift,
 * alloc isn't called when initializing an object, so you have to use the the
 * `make()` factory methods which call the alloc in objective-c.
